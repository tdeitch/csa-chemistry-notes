CSA Chemistry Notes
===================

In the summer of 2011, I taught a three-week chemistry intensive to prepare students for IB chemistry. To help them remember what we covered, I made them handouts for the first few days of class. I also administered tests and homework to measure their progress. Lots of material is missing, but this is what I have.
